This is a collection of perl and PHP scripts to make updating an LDAP
directory simple.  The scripts assume the ca-zephyr.org LDAP schema
and that the directory updates require GSSAPI authentication.  The
application was originally PHP only, but support for GSSAPI binds
to LDAP where never well documented or stable and now just don't
work.  All authenicated access to the directory uses PERL and PHP
is used to interact with web users.

This is a primitive application that suits the specific of the
ca-zephyr.org infrastructure.
